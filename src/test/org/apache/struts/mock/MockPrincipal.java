 * <p>Mock <strong>Principal</strong> object for low-level unit tests

 * <p><strong>WARNING</strong> - Only the minimal set of methods needed to
 * create unit tests is provided, plus additional methods to configure this
 * object as necessary.  Methods for unsupported operations will throw
 * <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>WARNING</strong> - Because unit tests operate in a single
