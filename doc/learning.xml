    <p>
    The <b>official documentation</b> for the framework is provided both 
    online and as a self-installing WAR in the distribution. 
    The <code>struts-documentation.war</code> includes our 
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>
    <a href="userGuide/index.html">User and Developer Guides</a>,
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="api/index.html">Comprehensive Javadocs</a>,
    </li>

    and everything else you find here.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    You are invited to preview the documentation online and then install 
    the application locally for closer study.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    <b>NOTE:</b> If you are previewing the documentation on the website, 
    most of the links in this section will refer to the <b>Nightly Build</b>.
    When learning about Struts, <b>be sure to refer to the documentation for 
    the version you are actually using</b>. 
    The documentation is bundled with each distribution as an application that 
    you can install and use locally.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The concise Struts <a href="userGuide/index.html"><b>User Guide</b></a> 
    introduces the Model-View-Controller architecture, and how it relates to 
    the major components of Struts.
    If you want to find out "How Struts works", this is the place to start.
    Along with an architectural overview, the User Guide also includes 
    detailed installation instructions and release notes for each version of 
    the framework.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our <b>Developer Guides</b> are detailed technical references to the extensions and components provided in the
        Struts distribution.
        Included are package overviews and API reference for each of the Struts taglibs, along with guides to the
        Struts Utilities and the Struts Validator.
        The Developer Guides are designed as a day-to-day reference to help you get the most out of the standard
        packages.
        Links to the various Developer Guides are provided as part of
        <a href="userGuide/index.html"><b>User Guide</b></a> menu.
    </p>

    <p>
    For more detail about a specific class or package, the Struts 
    <a href="api/index.html"><b>Javadocs</b></a> are <b>surprisingly 
    comprehensive and carefully maintained</b>. 
    It is <i>strongly</i> recommended that you refer to the 
    <a href="api/index.html"> Javadoc</a> for each class as you begin to use 
    it. 
    This will help ensure that important features and options are not 
    overlooked. 
    <i>What you don't know, can't help you.</i>
    </p>

    <p><a name="faqs"></a>
    The Struts <b>FAQs</b> are designed to fill in any small gaps left by the 
    Javadocs or the User and Developer Guides. 
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>The <a href="./faqs/kickstart.html">Kickstart FAQ</a> 
    answers the most common non-technical questions people first ask about 
    Struts. 
    </li>
    <li>
    The <a href="./faqs/newbie.html">Struts Newbie FAQ</a> answers the most 
    common technical questions asked by first-timer Struts developers. 
    </li>
    <li>
    The <a href="./faqs/helping.html">How to Help FAQ</a> answers the most 
    common questions about contributing to the Jakarta-Struts project. 
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p><a name="howtos"></a>
    The <b>Howto Guides</b> are designed to help you get started with some of 
    the optional extensions and components available for Struts. 
    These include topics like using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol 
    with Struts and how to unit test your Struts applications. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?StrutsProjectPages%20">Struts Wiki</a> is a
        relatively new addition to the Struts documentation.
        All members of the Struts Community are invited to post comments to the Wiki, as well as the User List.
        The Wiki is best suited for threads that you think are of lasting importance, while the mailing lists are best
        suited for incidental questions.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have any comments on the pages you see here, they can be posted to the Wiki by following the link on the
        bottom of any page.

    <p>
    Of course, the only true documentation is the code itself. 
    If you have any questions about how Struts actually works, do not hesitate 
    to <i>use the source</i>. 
    For the complete, buildable source code to the entire Struts framework, 
    see the "src" folder in the 
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/sourceindex.html"><b>your source 
    distribution</b></a>.
