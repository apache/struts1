    The <i>production release</i> of <strong>Struts 1.0.2</strong> is 
    available in a convenient binary distribution and also with complete 
    source code. 
    In addition, a library distribution is available, which contains the 
    latest Struts binaries without the documentation or sample applications, 
    providing a smaller, faster download.
    </p>

    release.

    <p>
    <b>In addition to a Struts distribution,</b> you will need to ensure that
    you have downloaded and installed all of the

    <p>
    A <i>release candidate</i> of <strong>Struts 1.1</strong> is also
    available, in the same three distributions. As a release candidate, this
    release is expected to be as stable as a production release, but there may
    be a few remaining issues which have not been previously encountered.

    For your convenience, the requisite JARs are provided as a single download under 
    the <code>lib</code> sub-directory with each release and beta distribution. 
    (The "Library Distribution" above.)
    Please note that the minimum requirements may change between releases 
    and betas, and some JARs may need to be updated to use the latest 
    Nightly Build.

    <p>
    For developers who are helping to develop Struts, or who just want "the 
    latest bits", the latest development version is made available each morning. 
    Use at your own risk!
    </p>

    <ul>
        
    <li>
        Nightly builds - Download the source directly via
        <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/getinvolved/cvsindex.html">
        Anonymous CVS</a>.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        Nightly builds - Download the binary distributions from the
       <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-struts/nightly">

        <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-struts/nightly/src">
        Struts nightly build source directory</a>.
    </li>
    
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    The nightly build relies on several JARs from the 
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons">Jakarta Commons</a>. 
    Nightly builds of all the Commons and Commons-Sandbox packages are  
    available from the 
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-commons/nightly/">
    Commons nightly build directory</a>. 
    Binary JARs are also available from the Apache Gump 
    <a href=" http://gump.covalent.net/jars/latest/">latest JARs 
    directory</a>. 
    (If you have trouble with a JAR after downloading it from Gump, 
    your browser may be interpreting it as a text file. 
    Try another browser or download the full distribution.)
    </p>
    
    <p>
    If you are building Struts from source, be sure to refer to the 
    <a href="userGuide/installation.html">Installation page</a> in the 
    User Guide for prerequesites.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    If you are interested in the Tag Library Descriptor (TLD) files, 
    they are maintained in the 
    <a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-struts/conf/share/">
    /conf/share</a> folder of he main repository. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Also be sure to check the
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/userGuide/release-notes.html">
    Release Notes</a> for the nightly builds so you know what you are getting!
    </p>
