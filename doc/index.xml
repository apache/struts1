  <section name="Welcome to Struts" href="Welcome">

  <p>
  Welcome to the Struts Framework!  The goal of this project
  is to provide an open source framework for building Web applications 
  that integrates standard technologies like 
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet"> Java Servlets</a>, 
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/">JavaBeans</a>, 
  and <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp">JavaServer 
  Pages</a> (JSP). 
  </p>
  <p>
  Struts encourages application architectures based the
  <b>Model-View-Controller</b> (MVC) design paradigm, colloquially known as
  <i>Model 2</i> in discussions on various Java mailing lists. Struts 
  provides its own <b>Controller</b> component and integrates 
  with other technologies to provide the Model and the View. 
  For the <b>Model</b>, Struts can interact with any standard data 
  access technology, including 
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/index.html">
  Enterprise Java Beans</a>, 
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdbc/index.html"> 
  JDBC</a>, and 
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/index.html"> 
  JNDI</a>. 
  For the <b>View</b>, Struts works well with 
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp">JavaServer 
  Pages</a>, 
  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/index.html">
  Velocity Templates</a>, 
  XSLT, and 
  <a href="resources.html#views">
  other presentation systems
  </a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Struts framework provides the invisible underpinnings every 
  professional Web application needs to survive. Struts helps you 
  create an extensible development environment for your application, 
  based on published standards and proven design patterns.
  </p>

  <p>
  Struts is part of the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org">Jakarta
  Project</a>, sponsored by the
  <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a>.  The
  official Struts home page is at
  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts">http://jakarta.apache.org/struts</a>.
  </p>

  </section>

  <section name="Learning About Struts" href="Docs">

  <p>
  The <b>official documentation</b> for the framework is provided both online 
  and as a self-installing WAR in the distribution. The 
  <code>struts-documentation.war</code> includes the 
  <a href="kickstart.html">Kickstart</a> and
  <a href="newbie.html">Newbie</a> FAQs,   
  <a href="userGuide/index.html">Users Guide</a>, 
  <a href="api/index.html">Javadocs</a>, and everything else you find here.
  You are invited to preview the documentation online, and then install the
  application locally for closer study. 
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  Note: Most of the links in this section refer to the <b>Nightly Build</b>. 
  When learning about Struts, <b>be sure to refer to the documentation for the 
  version you are actually using</b>. The documentation is bundled with each 
  distribution as an application that you can install locally. Links to the 
  documentation for the current stable release (1.0.2) are also provided on the 
  menu bar. Whenever possible, please help conserve our bandwidth, and install 
  the documentation locally.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  The <a href="kickstart.html"><b>Kickstart FAQ</b></a> quickly answers 
  the most common questions about Struts. More technical questions are 
  covered by the <a href="newbie.html">Struts Newbie FAQ</a>, and online in the Struts 
  <a href="http://jguru.com/faq/Struts">JGuru FAQ</a> and 
  <a href="http://jguru.com/forums/Struts">Forum</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  A concise <a href="userGuide/index.html"><b>Users Guide</b></a> is also provided 
  with the distribution. The Users Guide introduces the Model-View-Controller 
  architecture, and how it relates to the major components of Struts. Several <b>Developer 
  Guides</b> supplement the Users Guide. These help you get started with the Struts JSP 
  tag extensions and utility packages. The Users Guide also includes detailed installation 
  instructions and release notes for each version of the framework.
  </p>

  <p>
  For more detail about a specific class or package, the Struts 
  <a href="api/index.html"><b>Javadocs</b></a>
  are <b>surprisingly comprehensive and carefully maintained</b>. It is <i>strongly</i> recommended that 
  you refer to the 
  <a href="api/index.html">
  Javadoc</a> for each class as you begin to use it, to be sure important features 
  and options are not overlooked. <i>What you don't know, can't help you.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
  Of course, the only true documentation is the code itself. If you have any questions 
  about how Struts actually works, do not hesitate to <i>use the source</i>. For the 
  complete, buildable source code to the entire Struts framework, see the "src" folder in 
  the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-struts/release/v1.0.2/src/">
  <b>Struts 1.0.2 source distribution</b></a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Struts <a href="#Involved">Mailing Lists</a> are an treasure trove of useful, 
  interactive information. The list tends to carry a high volume, so always check the 
  published documentation and the 
  <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/struts-user%40jakarta.apache.org/">
  <b>MAILING LIST ARCHIVE</b></a> before 
  <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">posting a new question</a>. 
  Like as not, it's already been asked and answered.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Struts <a href="resources.html"><b>Resources</b></a> page provides links to 
  everything else published about  Struts, including 
  <a href="resources.html#books">books</a>, 
  <a href="resources.html#articles">articles</a>, 
  <a href="resources.html#tutorials">tutorials</a>, 
  <a href="resources.html#seminars">seminars</a>, 
  and sample applications. There are also links to public sites "Powered by Struts" and
  a directory of professional Struts consultants.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Struts <a href="news.html"><b>News &amp; Status</b></a> page highlights current 
  events affecting framework, including new releases, proposals for new features, 
  and additions to the Resources page.

  <section name="Acquiring Struts" href="Acquiring">

  <p>
  The <i>production release</i> of <strong>Struts 1.0.2</strong> is available in
  a convenient binary distribution and also with complete source code. In
  addition, a library distribution is available, which contains the latest
  Struts binaries without the sample applications, providing a smaller,
  faster download.

  <section name="Reporting Bugs and Feature Requests" href="Bugs">

  <p>
  Tracking of bug reports and enhancement requests for Struts is handled 
  through the 
  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/bugs.html">
  Apache Bug Database</a>. Please select <strong>Struts</strong> from the product 
  list, along with the details of which component of Struts you feel this report 
  relates to, and details of your operating environment. You will automatically be
  notified by email as the status of your bug or enhancement report changes. Please 
  be sure to read 
  <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">How to Report 
  Bugs Effectively</a> before posting.
  </p>

  </section>

  <section name="Contributing Patches to Code or Documentation" href="Patches">

  <p>
  You can upload a proposed <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/source.html#Patches">
  patch</a> to either the code or documentation by creating a feature request in 
  <a href="#Bugs">Bugzilla</a>. <b>After creating the ticket</b>, you can go back 
  and upload a file containing your patch. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The documentation is maintained in the <code>doc</code> folder of the CVS in a 
  XML format. In the Nightly Build, there is a "compile.website" target in the 
  <code>build.xml</code> file, which renders the XML into the HTML we post to the 
  Website. If you would like to help with the documentation, it is important to 
  provide patches and new pages in the XML source. Otherwise, some other volunteer 
  will have to do this for you, and it may never get done. (Sad but true.) If you 
  are submitting new material, it is important to decide exactly where you would 
  put this in relation to the rest of the documentation. Someone has to figure that 
  out before it can added, and that someone might as well you.
  </p>
  <p>
  New additions for the Resources page should posted as an enhancement request to 
  <a href="#Bugs">Bugzilla</a>.
