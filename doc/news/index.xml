<h3><a name="20021106.2"></a>06 Nov 2002 - Struts in Action now in print</h3>
<p>
The Manning book, Struts in Action, is now available for sale at the publisher's website and will arrive at bookstores everywhere over the next few weeks.
Struts solves the most common problems of Web development by providing an open source framework for building Web applications.
As the only book with full coverage of both Struts 1.0 and the upcoming Struts 1.1, Struts in Action points out the differences between the two and builds a case study that illustrates the transition from one to the other.
The authors of the Manning book are core members of the Struts community who are intimately involved in the Struts development process.
</p>
<p>
Manning makes this text available in either ebook edition for $22.47 or print edition for $44.95 at <a href="http://www.manning.com/husted">www.manning.com/husted</a>.
If you order the ebook from Manning's website first, you will receive a special offer on the print edition.
If you later purchase the print edition from the publisher's website, Manning will deduct the cost of the ebook from the print edition order - that's both editions for $44.95!
Please remember, to get this deal, you must order the ebook first.

<h3><a name="20021106"></a>06 Nov 2002 - Struts News Roundup</h3>
<p>
The
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/volunteers.html">Struts team</a> is proud to welcome 4 new Committers this month, David Karr, Eddie Bush, David Graham, and James Mitchell</p>
<p>
Everyone is working steadily toward the release of Struts 1.1 beta 3. To help keep everyone on track, the team added a
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/status.html">Development Roadmap</a>.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of "nice to haves" that won't make Struts 1.1 which are now slated for Struts 1.2. Farther down the road, Struts 2.0 will rely upon the new standards, like JavaServer Faces and JSTL.
</p>
<p>
The platform for Struts 1.1 will remain Servlet 2.2 and JSP 1.1. However, a Struts JSTL taglib is available in the nightly build contrib directory and will be released with Struts 1.1 as a separate download.
</p>
<p>
Solid Struts support for the other new standard,
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/proposals/struts-faces.html">Struts JavaServer Faces</a>,
is under development, but cannot be released quite yet.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the Struts User list will continue to enjoy its "casual Friday" policy. Off-topic messages are tolerated on Fridays so long as the message is prefixed with the token [FRIDAY]. Posting [FRIDAY] articles on any other weekday is strongly discouraged.

<h3><a name="20021105.2"></a>2002 Nov 05 - Struts Article on theServerSide.com</h3>
<p>
An article on Struts has been published on www.theServerSide.com. This
article titled 'Fast Track to Struts: What it Does and How' is primarily
written to assist new users get quickly familiar with Struts. It is
complementary to the information already available at
http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/userGuide/index.html. I am hoping that this
article will complement the efforts of the people already evangelizing
Struts adoption.
</p>
<p>
The introduction to the article is reproduced below.
</p>
<p>
Introduction<br />
------------<br />
The objective of this article is to introduce prospective Struts users to
the key benefits of using Struts, and at the same time illustrate its
configuration and usage semantics. We will define the requirements of a
robust presentation framework and simultaneously discuss how these
requirements are implemented in the Struts framework. We will also explore
the design patterns implemented by Struts, the semantics of the controller,
and the semantics of the associated helper components; this knowledge will
be useful when designing components that will interact with the framework,
and when there is a need for extending the framework for accommodating
special needs of a project. This article complements the information
available at http://jakarta.apache.org/struts.

<h3><a name="20021101"></a>2002 Nov 01 - New Struts Article posted on OnJava</h3>
<p>
Sorry for the self promotion, but I thought this article
might help some on thes list. I wrote a Struts "lessons
learned" article for O'Reilly that contains information
that is discussed here on the list frequently, but never
hurts to be explained in more detail.

<h3><a name="20020910"></a>2002 Sep 10 - ApplicationResources.properties from Database</h3>
<p>
For anyone interested, I have finished implementing DBMessageResources
which allows you to keep the key-value pairs (from your
ApplicationResources.properties) in a single database table.
</p>
<p>
You can load your property files into a table (generic schema is provided)
and with this extension, by only modifying &lt;message-resources> in the
struts-config.xml your application will run WITHOUT ANY code changes. (See
the readme.txt file included)
</p>
<p>
This extension uses OJB (http://jakarta.apache.org/ojb) O/R mapping for
database configuration and connection pool management.
</p>
<p>
I have included a modified version of the (1.1b2) struts-example to
demonstrate.
</p>
<p>
I have tested this with Struts 1.1b2, and I'm sure it will work with 1.1b1
(If anyone requires a 1.0.x compatible, I can look at that also)
</p>
<p>
I will get this project available as soon as I work through some cvs issues
on sf.net:
</p>
<p>
If anyone is REALLY itching to get their hands on it sooner, send me a
<a href="mailto:jholmes@apache.org">email</a>.
</p>
<p>
For those who were waiting, thanks for your patience.

<h3><a name="20020906"></a>Struts Q&amp;A Distilled, Vol#2</h3>
<p>
"Struts Q&amp;A Distilled" is a catalogue of question-and-answers distilled
from Struts mailing lists and other sources. The catalogue is organized in
topics. New entries are added to the catalogue periodically in batches.
</p>
<p>
Volume #2: <br />
<a href="http://www.scioworks.net/servlets/ShowPage?pid=34&amp;dp=3">http://www.scioworks.net/servlets/ShowPage?pid=34&amp;dp=3</a>
</p>
<p>
Covers:
</p>
<p>
Q1: It is recommended properties of the FormBeans should be String
properties. In that case, where do I do the type conversions?
</p>
<p>
Q2: How much does Struts depend on the session object and when is the
object created?
</p>
<p>
Q3: I have problem with using ActionErrors and &lt;html:errors>. I don't see
my messages. Why?
</p>
<p>
Q4: My error messages generated by &lt;html:errors> contain "null" at the
start and the end. What have I done wrong?
</p>
<p>
Q5: How do I prevent my form from being validated when it is displayed the
first time, if the JSP is fronted by an Action?
</p>
<p>
Q6: Struts 1.1 seems to support multiple resource bundles. How to use it?
</p>
<p>
Q7: After I replace my &lt;input type="submit"...> to &lt;html:submit...>, my
Javascript document.forms[0].submit() does not work anymore and returns me
"Object doesn't support this property or method". Why?
</p>
<p>
Q8: How do I configure Struts to intercept requests and perform some logic
before passing them to the controller servlet for processing?
</p>
<p>
Q9: How do I send binary data to the controller servlet? (e.g. a
Swing-based client sends serialized object to the controller servlet.)
</p>
<p>
Q10: I want to associate data with &lt;html:check> and return the selected
value as a String property in the FormBean. But I got exception coming from
RequestUtils.populate(). Why?

<h3><a name="20020905"></a>2002 Sep 05 - Struts 1.1: Should I Upgrade?</h3>
<p>
Built on the success of Struts 1.0, Struts 1.1 beta was released in March
this year and showcased at JavaOne 2002. This article describes the new
features found in Apache Struts 1.1 beta and the impact of migration from
Struts 1.0 to Struts 1.1. It also offers advice on the migration decision
and the upgrade process.

<h3><a name=""></a>Map -&gt; JavaBean API, arbitrary property names! dynclass.sourceforge.net</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://dynclass.sourceforge.net/">http://dynclass.sourceforge.net/</a> - a Class-creation API with very simple but powerful Map-to-JavaBeans translation.
</p>
<p>
I have recently added support for arbitrary property names (i.e. names
that contain spaces, operator chars, you name it).  So for example:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
Map myMap = ...;
myMap.put("email address", emailAddr);
Object myBean = BeanCreator.createBeanFromMap(myMap);

//...
&lt;bean:write name='myBean' property='email address'/>
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Much better than lots of Bean inner-classes!
</p>
<p>
I know a lot of Struts developers are using DynaBean et al and it seems to be working fine for
them.  If you need your beans to work within non-DynaBean-aware
frameworks this API would be a big help to you.
