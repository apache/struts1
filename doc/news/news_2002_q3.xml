<h3><a name=""></a>23 Jul 2002 - STL (Standard Tags) + Struts (MVC) live web Demo</h3>
<p>If you are starting a Java Web, you should use MVC and Standard tags,
this "kit" is a sample of "best" (at least good) practices.
</p><p>
It is MVC (Struts/Tiles)+JSTL +XSLT+ DAO (Open Source Data Access Object
w/ SQL) + DB CRUD (Create update delete and SQL DLL scripts)+ J2EE
Security ( to make Tomcat run like Apache )
</p><p>
It is KISS (you'll see how simple and how very standard) , good
practices Free Open Source Framework to develop any web app, with the
aim of being 80% of any app, but done as simple as possible and easy to
teach. Again, everything is standard and simple. And it is the fastest,
most efficient way to develop maintainable code I know of.
</p><p>
Samples include CMS (Authorize content, XSLT, CMS Comments, sinkable,
single sign on, etc.),  Issue tracking, + more coming.
</p><p>
Please download and install and see if you want to attend. Details:
<a href="http://basicportal.sourceforge.net">http://basicportal.sourceforge.net</a>

I use it to teach Struts + JSTL public and private classes. I epically
teach WHY you should want to do something in a certain way, not just how.
</p><p>
To attend and see "best practices"

The seminar requires you know servlets, jsp,  SQL, JDBC, and at least
some MVC. (a plus is if you have already deployed and MVC web app in the
past) Oh...it is $10.00 ( but free to baseBeans clients and/or apache.org
