                <p>
                    Through version 1.2.x, the project's codebase was bundled
                    as a single
                    distribution with a single release cycle.
                    Post version 1.2.x, the project's codebase is separated
                    into several
                    subprojects, each with its own distribution and release
                    cycle.
                    The core controller classes are now available as Struts
                    Action
                    Framework. The taglibs classes are now available as Struts
                    Taglib,
                    and so forth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Popular third-party extensions that are in active use by
                    the Struts
                    community may be considered as new subprojects,
                    such as those distributed through the
                    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/struts">
                        Struts SourceForge</a>
                    site.
                    (If you are the author of such an extension,
                    and would like to donate it to Apache Struts,
                    please contact the
                    <a href="http://struts.apache.org/mail.html">
                        Struts dev mailing list</a>
                    .)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Releases in the 1.x series will focus on refactoring of
                    existing functionality, with a continued emphasis on
                    backward
                    compatibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    New features are being added to the 1.x series,
                    but only if backward compatability with the prior release
                    can be
                    retained.
                    The framework's API is evolving through a strict
                    deprecate/replace/remove protocol.
                    Developers are encouraged to stay current with the "best
                    available"
                    release and to observe deprecation warnings.
                    Features are deprecated before removal, and deprecated
                    features are
                    removed in a subsequent release.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout the 1.x series,
                    there will be a continued emphasis on expanding unit test
                    coverage.
                    Bug reports should include a failing test case when
                    possible.
                    Proposals for new features should include a working test
                    suite.
                    (Creating features through Test Driven Development is
                    encouraged.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Enhancement requests are logged in Bugzilla as they are
                    suggested.
                    <strong>The listing of an enhancement in Bugzilla does not
                        imply that
                        it is being "planned"</strong>
                    ,
                    merely that someone has suggested it,
                    and the idea hasn't been ruled out (yet).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Future release
                    <a href="milestones.html">milestones</a>
                    are provided
                    for enhancements which are being actively planned or
                    developed
                    but may not be ready for the current release.
                    If a report has not been tagged for a specific milestone
                    by a working developer,
                    then
                    <strong>it may never be implemented</strong>
                    .
                    When developers (including non-Committers) are actually
                    working on an
                    enhancement,
                    they should re-tag it for a specific release milestone,
                    such as "1.3.1" or "1.3.2".
                </p>

                <p>
                    If an enhancement has not been tagged for a specific
                    target,
                    feel free to start working on it yourself.
                    Many of our best features have been contributed by
                    developers,
                    just like you.
                    If you are working on an enhancement,
                    post a note on the ticket that you are working on an
                    enhancement
                    and then post a patch as soon as possible.
                    If the development effort doesn't succeed,
                    post a note to the ticket explaining what problem you had
                    creating the enhancement,
                    so that other developers can explore alternatives.

                <p>
                    An outline of the enhancements proposed here
                    can be found on the

                    page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The 1.3.x series utilizes Struts Chain as the default
                    request
                    processor and adds an "extends" attribute to all the
                    configuration elements (a la Tiles).
                    We would also like to add a Ant-style properties file to
                    make
                    variable substitutions within the XML elements.
                    The substitution feature is supported by Spring and
                    iBATIS,
                    among others.
                    Substitutions are a useful way to configure applications
                    and reduce redundancy.

                    <b>Experimental Members</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    To lay the groundwork for future changes,
                    three "experimental" classes and interfaces are being
                    added to
                    the framework so that early adopters can experiment with
                    using
                    Struts Chain to develop applications.
                    We do consider these members experimental,
                    and they are subject to change,
                    based on our experience using them with our own
                    applications.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>ActionCommand</b>
                    - A Chain Command-like interface with one
                    method:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <code>void execute(ActionContext context)</code>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Support for conventional Actions would stay in place,
                    but as an alternative,
                    a class could implement ActionCommand and unbind itself
                    from the HTTP API.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>ActionContext</b>
                    - A
                    <i>Chain Context</i>
                    that implements the
                    logical Action class API.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Existing code could be converted by changing references to
                    context.* and so forth.
                    The context could be constructed by the Request Processor,
                    as an optional Command in the Chain,
                    so that it could be exposed this through thread-local,
                    opening the door for POJO actions
                    that don't implement a particular interface.

                    (pending) - A
                    <i>Chain Context</i>
                    that implements the
                    logical "Velocity Tools" API.

                <p>
                    In a later release, when the new members stabilize,
                    we could move the taglib dependencies from the servlet
                    contexts
                    to the ViewContext.
                    View technologies could then look exclusively to the
                    ViewContext
                    rather than poke around in the various servlet contexts.
                    (Of course,
                    support for the original architecture would remain for
                    some time,
                    to give third party libraries the chance to migrate.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    After having a chance to work with ActionContext and
                    ViewContext
                    ourselves,
                    we could introduce more support for these members in a
                    later
                    release.
                    But for 1.3.x, they could be marked "experimental".

                <p>
                    The Commons Chain WebContext we now pass around Struts
                    Chain
                    could be called the "StrutsContext" to differentiate it
                    from the
                    ActionContext and ViewContext.
                </p>

                <p>
                    (Are we now starting to call everything "Context" instead
                    of
                    "Action"?
                    Not really.
                    We use the "Context" suffix when a member extends Chain
                    Context.
                    This convention is unlike the current "Action" soup,
                    since "Context" is a suffix that identifies a member's
                    "family" history.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another experimental member is the catalog element,
                    which could be used to
                    to support using a Chain of ActionCommands
                    in lieu of an Action.

                    One we get past 1.3.x,
                    there are some other things that we might consider.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Consider combining DTDs.</b>
                    Right now,
                    using "standard" extensions like Tiles and Validator mean
                    using
                    more than one configuration file.
                    While using multiple configurations files can be a good
                    thing,
                    we should also try and support the idea of having a single
                    configuration file.
                    This might not work-out for Tiles,
                    but we might be able to at least integrate the Validator
                    configuration with the DynaForm configuration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Consider refactoring for Spring.</b>
                    We identified the need for adding a IOC container to
                    Struts
                    some time ago,
                    but stalled on the point of which to use.
                    Since then,
                    Spring has gained a lot of momentum.
                    Spring is used by the MyFaces and Beehive teams,
                    and its on the radar for Shale.
                    There is already a Struts-Spring component in the Spring
                    distribution and other common ground.

                <p>
                    Based on our own work with the "experimental" members
                    introduced in 1.3.x,
                    we might consider some other changes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Consider a "smart" action type.</b>
                    The idea is that a command in Struts chain could look at
                    the type
                    indicated by the ActionMapping so both Action classes and
                    ActionCommand implementations are supported.
                    People could then mix-and-match Actions with
                    ActionCommands
                    (or even chains of ActionCommands).
                    We might even try placing an ActionCommand interface on
                    ActionForm,
                    so people could skip having a seperate Action or
                    ActionCommand
                    class.
                    The ActionForm could do it all.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Consider a "populate" method on ActionForm.</b>
                    From an OOP standpoint,
                    it might be cleaner if an ActionForm populated itself
                    rather than
                    rely on a "god" class to populate it from the outside.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Consider a "FormContext" mechanism.</b>
                    Rather than "throw-away" a request-based ActionForm,
                    the object could be seralized as a hidden-field or
                    session-object
                    and restored on the next request.
                    Many other frameworks support this behavior now.
                    Struts would have a slightly different spin,
                    since we look at the form as an named entity rather than
                    as an
                    anonymous aggregation of other objects.

                    <b>Consider multiple controllers.</b>
                    One reason we introduced modules was because "there can
                    only be
                    one" Struts controller in an application.
                    With the context-based changes we making,
                    we might be able to introduce a mechanism to support a
                    collection
                    of Struts controllers,
                    each identified by its servlet or filter name,
                    each with it's own URI pattern.
                    The key to being able to do something like this is for
                    view
                    members to look to the ViewContext rather than the various
                    servlet
                    contexts.
                    Each Struts controller would place the appropriate
                    ViewContext in
                    its own requests.

                    <b>Consider an alternate configuration file.</b>

                    the
                    struts-config which often confuse new developers.
                    By either supporting alternative configuration loaders,
                    or applying a stylesheet to a XML configuration,
                    we could support both the "classic" and a new
                    configuration
                    (based on something like

            <subsection name="Portlet (JSR-168) Whiteboard">
                <p>
                    There are three major issues with supporting JSR-168
                    (and probably a bunch of smaller ones as well):
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        The framrwork APIs assume servlet API objects
                        (ServletContext,
                        ServletRequest, ServletResponse), whereas JSR-168
                        talks about
                        PortletContext, PortletRequest, and PortletResponse.
                        We'd either need to change the calling sequence for
                        Action.execute() -- problematic for backwards
                        compatibility --
                        or fake it somehow in a portlet environment.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The lifecycle of a portlet request is actually divided
                        into two
                        chunks -- processing and then rendering.
                        From a Struts perspective,
                        that means making sure that the first part of the
                        request
                        processor pipeline need to happen in the "process"
                        part,
                        and the forwarding to the resulting page needs to
                        happen in the
                        "render" part.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Today,
                        Struts owns the process of calculating URLs for pages
                        and actions.
                        Because it's in a webapp,
                        it knows exactly what to do for the developer.
                        However,
                        in a portlet container it's actually the portal server
                        that
                        manages URLs,
                        so a Struts-based portlet would need to interact with
                        the portlet
                        APIs for this purpose.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    A strong goal should be that an application should be
                    usable either as a webapp or as a portlet,
                    with little (ideally no) changes.
                    Therefore, we should build whatever it takes to support
                    this into
                    the standard framework distribution,
                    which could then be used in both environments.
