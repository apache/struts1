  <p>
    The "Struts Faces" component contains an add-on library that supports 
    the use of JavaServer Faces (JSF) user interface technology in a 
    Struts-based web application, in place of the Struts custom tag libraries.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Struts-Faces Integration Library should work with any implementation
    of JavaServer Faces, version 1.0 or later.  It has primarily been tested
    against <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/javaserverfaces/">
    version 1.1 of the JavaServer Faces reference implementation.</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    For more information, consult the
    <a href="README.txt" target="_blank">README</a> file.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  	Note that the Struts Faces component is intended as a "bridge" between 
  	Struts 1 and JavaServer Faces. 
  	The typical use case is a team that would like to experiment with JSF 
  	components but does not want to completely rework an existing application. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For better JavaServer Faces support, 
    consider using Struts 2 or 
    <a href="http://shale.apache.org/">Apache Shale.</a>
