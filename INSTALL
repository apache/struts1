                Struts
                ======

This document contains notes that have been accumulated on getting the Struts
applications (documentation and example) running in a variety of servlet
container environments.

For most containers, you need only to:

* Copy the WAR files in your Struts < /webapp > directory to your containers
  < webapps > directory.

* In some cases, you may need to restart your container if it is running.

Status of various containers -- as reported by volunteers on the Struts-User list.

* Tomcat 3.1+ Standalone - No additonal steps required.
* Resin 2.1+ Standalone - No additional steps required.
* WebLogic 6.0+ - No additional steps required.

* Bluestone Universal Business Server - Additional steps provided below.
* JRUN - Additional steps provided below.
* Orion Application Server - Additional steps provided below.
* Tomcat 3.1+ with Apache - Additional steps provided below.
* Weblogic 5.1 (sp8) - Additional steps provided below.

* Websphere - Determination pending.


BLUESTONE UNIVERSAL BUSINESS SERVER
-----------------------------------

*   You need UBS version 7.2 to run war file applications.  The UBS 7.2.2
    evaluation is located here:

        http://www.bluestone.com/SaISAPI.dll/SaServletEngine.class/products/downloads.jsp

*   If you're using version 7.2.1, you need to download the WAR file patch,
    located in the product enhancement section of Bluestone's website:

        http://www.bluestone.com/SaISAPI.dll/SaServletEngine.class/products/wfe.jsp

*   After installation of the correct version and/or patch of UBS 7.2, you
    need to modify your apserver.txt file to point to the correct directory
    for your war file applications.  Look for the section that says something
    similar to the following:

        [SaServletEngine.class]
        session_affinity=1
        type=1
        program=/SaServletEngine.class
        file_path=f:\webapps
        host=localhost:20000

*   Use the directory specified by the "file_path" variable, or modify it
    to point to your own custom webapp directory.  Copy the
    "struts-documention.war" and "struts-example.war" files into that
    webapp directory, and start the UBS (read documentation distributed
    with UBS for information on how to start it if necessary).  Your webapps
    are now accessible from the following URL's:

        http://localhost/<PLUGIN>/SaServletEngine.class/struts-example/
        http://localhost/<PLUGIN>/SaServletEngine.class/struts-documentation/


*   "<PLUGIN>" represents the plugin you are using for your specific
    webserver.  For apache on Windows, it might be "cgi-bin/SaCGI.exe",
    for IIS on Windows, it might be "scripts/SaCGI.exe" or "scripts/ISAPI.dll".
    Consult the UBS documentation for more information.


JRUN 3.0 SP2A, VERSION 3.02A.11614
----------------------------------
Tested with: Microsoft IIS 5.0, Windows 2000


Important Note:
===============

At the moment, JRun is not fully compliant with the JSP 1.1/1.2
specification. 

Specifically, the automatic type conversions for custom tag parameters 
specified in "Issue  7" of the JSP 1.1 Errata and in the JSP 1.2 Proposed 
Final Draft have not yet been implemented.

As it stands, JSP pages that make use of Struts taglibs whose parameters
require  conversion (such as booleans) will not compile under JRun. This 
includes the Struts Example Application. Attempting to run the example 
application will result in an exception similar to the following being 
thrown:

    /struts-example/index.jsp:

    javax.servlet.ServletException: Compilation error occured: 

    allaire.jrun.scripting.DefaultCFE: 

    Errors reported by compiler:
    c:/JRun/servers/default/Struts Example/WEB-INF/jsp/jrun__index2ejspa.java:41:1:41:27: 
    Error: No match was found for method "setLocale(java.lang.String)".

(For more details refer to:

< http://www.mail-archive.com/struts-user@jakarta.apache.org/msg01860.html >)

The following instructions describe how to install the Struts Example
Application under JRun. A subsequent section describes how the Struts Example 
Application can be patched to work with Struts


The following instructions assume the following:

* JRun has been installed and integrated with the web server of choice

* $APP_SERVER_NAME is the name of the application server used to host the 
  application.  (When JRun is first installed, it creates an application 
  server called JRun Default Server)

* $APP_SERVER_DIR is the directory used to hold applications hosted by 
  $APP_SERVER_NAME.  For the JRun Default Server, the directory is 
  $JRUN_HOME/servers/default where $JRUN_HOME is the directory where 
  JRun is installed.

Installing The Struts Example Application
-----------------------------------------

* Login to the JRun Management Console.

* On the left pane, select $APP_SERVER_NAME.  A page showing the
  current server status will be shown on the right pane.

* On the right pane, click on the WAR Deployment link.  A page
  containing a list of the currently deployed web applications will be 
  shown.

* On the right pane, click on Deploy an Application.  Complete the Web 
  Application Information form as follows:
  
    o Servlet War File or Directory:  Enter the full path where
      struts-example.war is found or click on Browse to select 
      the path.
    o JRun Server Name:  $APP_SERVER_NAME
    o Application Name:  Struts Example
    o Application Hosts:  All Hosts
    o Application URL:   /struts-example
    o Application Deploy Directory:  will default to 
      $APP_SERVER_NAME/Struts Example (or the name as specified for 
      Application Name)

* Once the form is complete, click on the Deploy button.

* If deployment is successful, restart the application server by
  clicking on $APP_SERVER_NAME on the left pane. A page showing the 
  current server status will be shown on the right pane. Click the 
  Restart Server button to restart the application server.

* Test the sample application by using the following URL in the
  browser:
            http://hostname/struts-example/index.jsp

  The struts-documentation.war can be installed using the same 
  procedure.


Installing Unpacked Web Applications
------------------------------------

The above steps should be followed for applications deployed as *.war files.

For unpacked web applications, configuration involves the following steps:

* From the JRun Management Console, select $APP_SERVER_NAME (on the
  left pane) and click on WAR Deployment (on the right pane)

* On the right pane, click on Create an Application and complete the
  Web Application Information form as follows:

* JRun Server Name:  $APP_SERVER_NAME

  o Application Name:  myApplication
  o Application Hosts:  All Hosts
  o Application URL:   /myApplication
  o Application Deploy Directory:  will default to
    $APP_SERVER_NAME/myApplication

* Click on Create to submit the form.

* Once the web application is created, install and configure the struts
  components (struts.jar, struts*.tld, etc) for the web application under 
  $APP_SERVER_NAME/myApplication/WEB-INF
  
* Install the remaining components of the application:  .class files,
  JSP pages,.properties files etc  as required.

* To configure the extension mapping of the request URI (ie *.do) to
  the action servlet, expand $APP_SERVER_NAME on the left pane, expand 
  the Web Applications branch and click on myApplication. The right pane 
  will display the configuration options for myApplication. Click on 
  Servlet URL Mappings. A list of existing mappings will be shown. Click 
  the Edit button and create the following entry:
  
  o Virtual Path/Extension:   *.do
  o Servlet Invoked:  action

* Click on the Update button to save the changes.
* Restart the application server.
* The application should now be accessible from the browser.

The JRun application server will need to be restarted each time one of the
following changes are made to the web application:

* .class or .jar files are modified

* .properties files are modified

* .xml files are modified


Patching The Struts Example Application
---------------------------------------

As mentioned at the beginning of these notes, the Struts Example Application
will not run under JRun without modification.  The following changes will need 
to be made:

* index.jsp, logon.jsp: Change <html:html locale="true"> to
                               <html:html locale=<%= true %>>
                               
* registration.jsp, subscription.jsp: Change all instances of 
  filter="true" to filter=<%= true %>
 

ORION APPLICATION SERVER
------------------------

* In the steps below, $ORION_HOME refers to the directory in which you
  have installed Orion, and $STRUTS_HOME is the directory in which you
  unpacked the Struts binary distribution.

* Modify the file "$ORION_HOME/config/application.xml" to define the two
  new applications, by adding the following declarations, immediately
  following the <web-module> directive for the default web application:

    <web-module id="strutsDoc"
         path="$STRUTS_HOME/webapps/struts-documentation.war"/>

    <web-module id="strutsExample"
         path="$STRUTS_HOME/webapps/struts-example.war"/>

* Modify the file "$ORION_HOME/config/default-web-site.xml" (or the
  configuration file for any other Orion web site) to include the following
  declarations, after the declaration for the <default-web-app> if any:

    <web-app application="default" name="strutsDoc"
                 root="/struts-documentation"/>

    <web-app application="default" name="strutsExample"
                 root="/struts-example"/>

* After you start Orion, you should now be able to access these applications
  (assuming you haven't changed the port number from the default of 80) at:

    http://localhost/struts-documentation

    http://localhost/struts-example

* Versions of Orion up to at least 1.0.3 have a bug related to
  ServletContext.getResource() calls that prevent the Struts example
  application from working out of the box.  This manifests itself as a
  JSP error when you try to access the example application, with the
  following message:

    javax.servlet.jsp.JspException:  Missing resources attribute
      org.apache.struts.action.MESSAGE

  followed by an error traceback.  There will also be an initialization
  error message in the "$ORION_HOME/log/global-application.log" log file.
  To work around this problem, you can take the following steps:

  - Go to the "$STRUTS_HOME/webapps" directory, where you will note that
    Orion has automatically expanded each web application into an
    unpacked directory structure.

  - Go to the "$STRUTS_HOME/webapps/struts-example/WEB-INF" directory,
    and copy the file "struts-config.xml" one directory up (that is, into
    "$STRUTS_HOME/webapps/struts-example".

  - Modify the "$STRUTS_HOME/webapps/struts-example/WEB-INF/web.xml" file,
    changing the value of the "config" initialization parameter (for the
    action servlet) from "/WEB-INF/struts-config.xml" to "/struts-config.xml".

  - Restart Orion, and you should be able to access the example application.

  Note that this workaround has a negative security-related side effect:
  your "struts-config.xml" file can now be retrieved by remote clients at the
  following URL:

    http://localhost/struts-example/struts-config.xml

  Therefore, you should be sure you do not store sensitive information
  (such as database passwords) in this file.


SILVERSTREAM APPLICATION SERVER 3.7.1
-------------------------------------

Start the SilverStream application server. 

Create an XML deployment plan for the "struts-example.war" application.

Call the file "struts-example-depl-plan.xml". You can use the following 
contents for the file 

----- cut here -----

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE warJarOptions PUBLIC
      "-//SilverStream Software, Inc.//DTD J2EE WAR Deployment Plan//EN"
      "deploy_war.dtd">
    <warJarOptions>
    <warJar>
    <warJarName>struts-example.war</warJarName>
    <isEnabled>true</isEnabled>
    <urls><el>struts-example</el></urls>
    </warJar>
    </warJarOptions>

----- cut here -----

Create an XML deployment plan for the "struts-documentation.war" 
application.

Call the file "struts-documentation-depl-plan.xml". You can use the 
following contents for the file:

----- cut here -----

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE warJarOptions PUBLIC
      "-//SilverStream Software, Inc.//DTD J2EE WAR Deployment Plan//EN"
      "deploy_war.dtd">
    <warJarOptions>
    <warJar>
    <warJarName>struts-example.war</warJarName>
    <isEnabled>true</isEnabled>
    <urls><el>struts-documentation</el></urls>
    </warJar>
    </warJarOptions>

----- cut here -----

Run the following "SilverCmd DeployWAR" commands to deploy the applications. 
You can change 'localhost' to whatever server you are deploying to. You can 
change 'Silvermaster' to whatever database you are deploying to.

SilverCmd DeployWar localhost Silvermaster struts-example.war 
  -f struts-example-depl-plan.xml 
SilverCmd DeployWar localhost Silvermaster struts-documentation.war 
  -f struts-documentation-depl-plan.xml 


TOMCAT 3.1 (OR LATER) WITH APACHE
---------------------------------

* These instructions assume you have successfully integrated
  Tomcat with Apache according to the Tomcat documentation.

* Copy "struts-documentation.war" and "struts-example.war"
  to your $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps directory

* Restart Tomcat if it is already running

* Tomcat will generate a file "$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-apache.conf"
  that will be used by Apache.  This file is regenerated every time
  you start Tomcat, so copy this file to a safe place (such as
  your Apache configuration directory; on Unix systems this is usually
  "/usr/local/apache/conf".

* If you are running Tomcat 3.1, Tomcat will not have generated the
  entries for your new applications.  Add the following lines to the
  "tomcat-apache.conf" file that you have saved, replacing
  $TOMCAT_HOME with the path to your Tomcat home directory:

        Alias /struts-documentation "$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/struts-documentation"
    <Directory "$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/struts-documentation>
      Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    </Directory>
    ApJServMount /struts-documentation/servlet /struts-documentation
    <Location "/struts-documentation/WEB-INF/">
      AllowOverride None
      deny from all
    </Location>

    Alias /struts-example "$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/struts-example"
    <Directory "$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/struts-example>
      Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    </Directory>
    ApJServMount /struts-example/servlet /struts-example
    <Location "/struts-example/WEB-INF/">
      AllowOverride None
      deny from all
    </Location>

* On all versions of Tomcat, the generated file above does not
  know anything about extension mappings defined in a web.xml file,
  so the "*.do" URIs that go to the controller servlet will not be
  recognized.  To fix this, add the following line to the saved
  version of "tomcat-apache.conf", after the corresponding line
  for the .jsp extension:

    AddHandler jserv-servlet .do

* Ensure that the saved version of "tomcat-apache.conf" is referenced
  in your Apache "httpd.conf" configuration file.  A typical use would
  have the following line at the bottom of "httpd.conf":

    Include /usr/local/apache/conf/tomcat-apache.conf

* In order to recognize "index.jsp" as a default page for web
  applications, search in your "httpd.conf" for a "DirectoryIndex"
  directive.  If you have one, add "index.jsp" to the end of the
  list, so that it might look like this:

    DirectoryIndex index.html index.jsp

  If you do not have such an entry, add one like this:

    DirectoryIndex index.jsp

* Restart Apache to make it aware of the new applications.  You should
  now be able to access the applications from a browser like this:

    http://localhost/struts-documentation
    http://localhost/struts-example


WEBLOGIC 5.1 (service pack 8)
-----------------------------

* Obtain and install the Xerces XML parser (problems have been reported
  with the Sun reference implementation). Put xerces.jar in your WebLogic system
  path.

* Obtain and unpack the Struts binary distribution (this procedure assumes
  it was extracted to C:\jakarta-struts).

* Add an entry to weblogic.properties for each of the Struts web
  applications that you would like to configure. For example, to make the
  struts-example application available, add the following line to
  weblogic.properties:

    weblogic.httpd.webApp.strutsexample=c:/jakarta-struts/webapps/struts-example.war

* You do not need to include struts.jar or any of the application specific
  classes in the WebLogic classpath, since this will be done automatically
  (unless deploying an unpacked web archive- see below).

* Start WebLogic server and point your web browser to the struts
  application. For example, to connect to the example application added in
  step 3:

    http://localhost:7001/strutsexample

* This example application depends on the Struts specific resource file
  ApplicationResources.properties to be present on the classpath. However,
  WebLogic only extracts *.class files from the archive so this file will not
  be found, resulting in an error the first time it is needed- something
  similar to: javax.servlet.ServletException: runtime failure in custom tag
  'message'. Steps 6 & 7 will need to be performed for this application, and
  any other that relies on ApplicationResources.properties.

* Extract ApplicationResources.properties from the *.war file, and
  manually copy it to the respective package in the _tmp_war_ directory
  WebLogic created for this application. Again referring to the struts-example
  application, this would be:

    c:\jakarta-struts\webapps\WEB-INF\_tmp_war_strutsexample

* Restart WebLogic. You will now be able to run the application:

    http://localhost:7001/strutsexample

* The above steps should be followed for applications deployed as *.war
  files. For unpacked web applications, configuration involves adding both
  struts.jar and /WEB-INF/classes to the WebLogic classpath. For this reason,
  I would suggest deploying applications as war files to WebLogic. However,
  the same example application can be successfully deployed in extracted
  format by modifying weblogic.properties (assuming the war was extracted to
  directory webapps/struts-example):

    weblogic.httpd.webApp.strutsexample=c:/jakarta-struts/webapps/struts-example/

    And starting WebLogic with the updated WebLogic classpath. For example:

    c:\jdk1.3\bin\java -ms16m -mx64m
        -classpath c:\weblogic\lib\weblogic510sp8boot.jar;
            c:\weblogic\classes\boot;
            c:\xerces\xerces.jar -Dweblogic.class.path=c:\weblogic\lib\weblogic510sp8.jar;
            c:\weblogic\license;
            c:\weblogic\classes;
            c:\weblogic\myserver\serverclasses;
            c:\weblogic\lib\weblogicaux.jar;
            c:\jakarta-struts\lib\struts.jar;
            c:\jakarta-struts\webapps\struts-example\WEB-INF\classes
                -Dweblogic.system.home=c:\weblogic-Djava.security.manager
                -Djava.security.policy=c:\weblogic\weblogic.policyweblogic.Server
