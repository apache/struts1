# ---------------------------- BUILD MODE -------------------------------------

# Uncomment the following property setting to build web applications that will
# include all of the required libraries, and therefore run on containers other
# than the Java Web Services Developer Pack (JWSDP) 1.2 or later, which makes
# many of these libraries available to web applications already.

build.standalone=true


# ---------------------- DEPENDENCY HOME DIRECTORIES --------------------------


# The absolute or relative pathname to your installation of the JavaServer Faces
# refererence implementation (version 1.1 or later).
jsf.home=/usr/local/jsf-1_1

# The absolute or relative pathname to your installation of the JSP Standard
# Tag Library.  If you are running against a Servlet 2.3 / JSP 1.2 container
# (such as Tomcat 4.1.x), use version 1.0.x of JSTL.  For a Servlet 2.4 /
# JSP 2.0 container (such as Tomcat 5.0.x or any JWSDP release), use
# version 1.1.x of JSTL.
jstl.home=/usr/local/standard-1.0.3

# The absolute or relative pathname to your installation of Tomcat 4.1.x,
# Tomcat 5.0.x, or the Java Web Services Developer Pack (version 1.4 or later)

# ------------------------------- TOMCAT INTEGRATION --------------------------

# The build.xml file for this package includes commands that leverage the
# manager webapp of Tomcat 4.1 or 5.0 to dynamically install, reload, or
# remove the example web application.  In order for these targets to work,
# you must copy the "catalina-ant.jar" file from the "server/lib" directory
# of your Tomcat or JWSDP installation into the "lib" directory of your
# Ant installation, and customize the following properties as needed.

# The URL of the manager web application on your Tomcat or JWSDP installation
url=http://localhost:8080/manager

# The username and password of a Tomcat user that you have configured to
# possess the "manager" role.  You can use the admin webapp to configure
# such a user, if one does not exist already
username=tomcat
password=tomcat

# The context path to which the example web application will be deployed
example.path=/struts-faces
example2.path=/struts-faces2


# ------------------------- System Integration Test Properties -----------------

# The following properties are only required if you wish to execute the
# system integration test client against the corresponding webapp.

# or later.  This code can be acquired at SourceForge.
htmlunit.home=/usr/local/htmlunit-1.2.3

# The type of JSF state saving that should be used when the system integration
# test web application is depoyed ("client" or "server")
systest.state.saving=server
